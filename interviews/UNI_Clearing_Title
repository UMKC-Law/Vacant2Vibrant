•	Problem is with the notice
•	Presumption of no notice
•	Statute hasn’t been updated since 1940s
•	Mennonite notice 1980s
•	Things that pass
o	Could change tax foreclosure statute to require Mennonite notice
♣	Requires certain things if green cards haven’t been signed
♣	First American title helped draft (statute would require title report)
♣	Statute would require title reports on all tax sale properties
♣	County doesn’t want to do that—no matter how much it costs, they would have to add that to the minimum bid & would have to get legislature to sign off on that
♣	Idea is that legislature doesn’t want to add more fees
♣	*ran into a dead end—this was just Ted doing this
o	High risk premium for title insurance
♣	Could do this, but have to be able to justify this if their challenged by the Missouri Insurance commissioner
♣	They’re supposed to make $34 off of insurance policies
♣	These require more work because you need notice file from county etc.
♣	Went to the state insurance commission and they were cool with it.
♣	Insurance industry isn’t into this idea, but they’re still pursuing this.
♣	**these titles are insurable by law
o	UMKC title clinic came out of this
♣	& pro-bono work too
♣	Denton is going to quiet 85 titles
♣	Other pro bono services
o	Tax Title Services out of CA—reinsurer for title insurance companies (tax title experts) Charge an extra $800
♣	Still waiting for a MO underwriter
o	People think that Jackson & KC should indemnify (Peter)
•	Committee members
