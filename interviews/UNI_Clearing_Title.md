Interview: UNI Clearing Title Committe Co-Chair: Ted Anderson
=====

The Clearing Title Committee's goal is to make tax titles in Kansas City, Jackson County, Missouri insurable.

Committee Members:

  * David Larabee (Chair)

  * Ted Anderson, Executive Director of Land Bank (Co-Chair)
  
  * Bret Hart, Clear Title 
  
  * David Noyce, title insurance attorney
  
  * BcClain Bryant, City of Kansas City, Missouri, Office of the Mayor
  
  * Ed Linnebur, LISC


Problems:

  * Courts and title companies have different standards of proper notice (e.g., is a certified letter from the county enough notice to lien holders?)
  * The current presumption of title companies is that the parties did not receive notice.
  * Another issue is that the notice statute has not been updated since the 1940s.
  * "Mennonite notice" became the practice of Missouri courts in the 1980s


Possible solutions:

  * Could change the tax foreclosure statute to require Mennonite notice
    *  Requires certain things if green cards haven't been signed (evidence that the party has received notice)
    * Statute would require title reports on all tax sale properties
    * This could be costly, however, and the County would likely have to add this to the minimum bid.
  * High*Risk premium for title insurance
    * This could be challenged by the Missouri Insurance Commisioner
    * Under the current system, title insurance companies usually make around $34 form insurance policies
    * These properties require more work because they require notice file from county, but are also riskier
  * UMKC Quiet Title Clinic
    * Pro bono attorneys are also part of this solution
    * This clinic is currently in its second semester
    * Denton is going to quiet 85 titles
  * Reinsurer for Title Insurance Companies
    * Tax Title Services, a California company, is a reinsurer for title insurance companies and are tax title experts
    * This will cost an extra $800
    * Before they can begin operation, a Missouri underwriter is needed
