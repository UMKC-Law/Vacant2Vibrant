Other questions:

•	What does “up to code” mean?
o	The “code” is the City’s Housing and Rehabilitation Code available at: http://kcmo.gov/planning/building-rehab-code-2/.
o	The property should be maintained, free of nuisance vioaltions.
•	What if the property cannot be accessed by road?
o	Land locked properties are not for sale because it would encourage trespass. 

•	What if I want several properties for a project?
o	Meet with Ted to discuss this. The Land Bank cannot sell more than 5 contiguous lots. The Kansas City, Missouri Homesteading Authority, however, can do this and has taken on a role of being involved with larger developments.
•	What if I want to purchase a vacant lot and build on it later?
o	This is pretty common. In the offer, include the plans for prepping the land and pay the remaining of the 2/3 of assessed value to the Land Bank at closing.
