PROBLEM
=======

An abundance of vacant, single-family residential properties in Kansas City, Missouriâ€™s urban core is detrimental to the vibrancy of its neighborhoods.
Vacant properties range anywhere from empty fields to large three story homes needing extensive renovation work.  Vacant lots and homes often fall into disrepair and can be unattractive, dangerous, and leave gaps in the social fabric in the neighborhood.  These gaps create opportunities for criminal activity to take place on the property or nearby.  This results in plummeting property values for nearby homeowners.

FOCUS OF PROJECT - Acquiring  Vacant Property
=============================================

Acquiring vacant property can be a significant challenge regardless if that property is publicly or privately owned. Privately owned vacant properties have typically gone through a lengthy period of abandonment, making contacting current owners or interest holders almost impossible. Publicly owned properties similarly face challenges including clearing potential title defects and navigating bureaucratic processes.
