PROBLEM
=======

An abundance of vacant, single-family residential properties in Kansas City, Missouri’s urban core is detrimental to the vibrancy of its neighborhoods.
Vacant properties range anywhere from empty fields to large three story homes needing extensive renovation work.  Vacant lots and homes often fall into disrepair and can be unattractive, dangerous, and leave gaps in the social fabric in the neighborhood.  These gaps create opportunities for criminal activity to take place on the property or nearby.  This results in plummeting property values for nearby homeowners.

FOCUS OF PROJECT - Acquiring  Vacant Property
=============================================

Acquiring vacant property can be a significant challenge regardless if that property is publicly or privately owned. Privately owned vacant properties have typically gone through a lengthy period of abandonment, making contacting current owners or interest holders almost impossible. Publicly owned properties similarly face challenges including clearing potential title defects and navigating bureaucratic processes.

SOLUTION
========

Solution 1: Vacant Lots
-----------------------

Vacant lots can be stabilized or developed by an interested party.  “Stabilized” describes methods that improve the property or give it a temporary use until the owner has the financial means to rehab or build a home on the lot.  Developers looking to temporarily “stabilize” a property should refer to the Guidebook for Infill Lot Improvement Strategies.  Some owners may “stabilize” the property by converting it to a community garden, playground, etc. without the intention of developing the property further.  
Vacant lots can be developed with structures as either rentals or single family use depending on the developer’s interests.  If the market signals there is enough interest for additional new homes in the area, this would be the highest and best use for most of the vacant properties.

Solution 2: Vacant Homes
-------------------------

Vacant properties that already contain a physical structure can be stabilized or developed.  Stabilizing would involve additional methods of repairing the exterior envelope of the building to prevent additional damage due to weather.  All openings must be properly secured to prevent break-ins.  The overall appearance of the physical structure should be improved enough to no longer be an “eyesore” to the surrounding residents, and comply with all municipal ordinances.  This could involve minor trim and gutter repair, painting, landscaping, etc.

Developing a vacant property with an existing structure could involve an array of solutions.  If the property is in such disrepair that major renovation is not economically feasible, the structure should be demolished and replaced by a new home. (Demolition is discouraged as many historic properties can be saved with professional guidance from architects and engineers).  The existing structure(s) could be renovated and historic character restored bringing long-term value to the neighborhood. Properties could be sold by the developer for single family occupancy or held and rented as a source of income
